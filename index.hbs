    <h1>About This Course</h1>

    <div class="module">
        <p>This course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning and statistical modeling. While mathematical methods and theoretical aspects will be covered, the primary goal is to provide students with the tools and principles needed to solve the data science problems found in practice.  This course also serves as a foundation on which more specialized courses and further independent study can build.</p>

    <p>This course was designed as part of the core curriculum for the Center for Data Science's <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/ms-in-data-science/">Masters degree in Data Science</a>. Other interested students who satisfy the prerequisites are welcome to take the class as well.  Note that class is intended as a continuation of <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/course-pages/ds-ga-1001-intro-data-science/">DS-GA-1001 Intro to Data Science</a>, which covers some important, fundamental data science topics that may not be explicitly covered in this DS-GA class (e.g. data cleaning, cross-validation, and sampling bias).</p>

        <p>This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, graders, and the instructor. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, you are encouraged to <a href="https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2016/dsga1003/home">post your questions on Piazza</a>. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email <a href="mailto:team@piazza.com">team@piazza.com</a>.

        <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/course-pages/ds-ga-1001-intro-data-science/"><strong>DS-GA-1001: Intro to Data Science</strong></a> or its equivalent
            <li><strong>Solid mathematical background</strong>, equivalent to a 1-semester undergraduate course in each of the following: linear algebra, multivariate calculus (primarily differential calculus), probability theory, and statistics.
            <li><strong>Python programming required</strong> for all homework assignments (not necessary for auditors)
            <li><em>Recommended:</em> Computer science background up to a "data structures and algorithms" course
            <li><em>Recommended:</em> At least one advanced, proof-based mathematics course
            <li>Some prerequisites may be waived with permission of the instructor.
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h1>Grading</h1>
        <p><strong>Homework (40%) + One-Hour Test (15%) + Two-Hour Test (25%) + Project (20%)</strong></p>
        <p>
            Many homework assignments will have problems designated as “optional”.  At the end of the semester, strong performance on these problems may lift the final course grade by up to half a letter grade (e.g. B+ to A-  or A- to A), especially for borderline grades.  You should view the optional problems primarily as a way to engage with more material, if you have the time.  Along with the performance on optional problems, we will also consider significant contributions to Piazza and in-class discussions for boosting a borderline grade.

            Elements of Statistical Learning</cite> (Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani)</a>
            <dd>This will be our principal textbook for the first part of the course.  It's written by three statisticians who invented many of the techniques discussed. Despite its popularity and the pretty pictures, this is not an easy book.  There's an easier version of this book that covers many of the same topics, described below. (Available for free as a PDF.)

            <dt><a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"><cite>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</cite> (James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani)</a>
            <dd>This book is written
            by two of the same authors as The Elements of Statistical Learning. It's much less intense mathematically, and it's good for a lighter introduction to the topics. (Available for free as a PDF.)

            <dt><a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage"><cite>Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning</cite> (David Barber)</a>
            <dd>We'll use this as a reference for probabilistic modeling, including Bayesian methods, and Bayesian networks. (Available for free as a PDF.)

            <dt><a href="https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/PRML/"><cite>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</cite> (Christopher Bishop)</a>
            <dd>This book is another very nice reference for probabilistic models and beyond.  It's highly recommended.

            <dt><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/index.html"><cite>Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</cite> (Kevin P. Murphy)</a>
            <dd>This book covers an unusually broad set of topics, including recent advances in the field. As such, it's a great reference to have, particularly if you continue your study of data science beyond this course.  That said, it was the required textbook for this course in 2015, and many students found it a bit overwhelming. It's really intended as a comprehensive, PhD-level textbook.

            <dt><a href="https://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/"><cite>Convex Optimization</cite> (Boyd and Vandenberghe)</a>
            <dd>This book was an instant hit in the machine learning community when it was published in 2004.  We will be making light use of this book, mostly for its coverage of Lagrangians and duality.  However, it's a good book to get familiar with, as it's very well written, and it covers a lot of techniques used in more advanced machine learning literature. (Available for free as a PDF.)

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> is "the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python." Our homework assignments will use NumPy arrays extensively.
        <li><a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> is a comprehensive machine learning toolkit for Python. We won't use this for most of the homework assignments, since we'll be coding things from scratch. However, you may want to run the scikit-learn version of the algorithms to compare the outputs to your own, as a check. Besides that, it should be useful for many final projects, and studying the source code can be a good learning experience.  One of the core developers, <a href="http://amueller.github.io">Andreas M&uuml;ller</a>, is a Research Engineer in NYU's Center for Data Science.

            <li><a href="http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/">CVXPY</a> and <a href="http://cvxopt.org/index.html">CVXOPT</a> are for solving convex optimization problems in Python. Could be useful for checking your homework results.
