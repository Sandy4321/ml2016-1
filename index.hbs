    <h1>About This Course</h1>

    <div class="module">
        <p>This course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning and statistical modeling. While mathematical methods and theoretical aspects will be covered, the primary goal is to provide students with the tools and principles needed to solve the data science problems found in practice.  This course also serves as a foundation on which more specialized courses and further independent study can build.</p>

	<p>This course was designed as part of the core curriculum for the Center for Data Science's <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/ms-in-data-science/">Masters degree in Data Science</a>. Other interested students who satisfy the prerequisites are welcome to take the class as well.  Note that class is intended as a continuation of <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/course-pages/ds-ga-1001-intro-data-science/">DS-GA-1001 Intro to Data Science</a>, which covers some important, fundamental data science topics that may not be explicitly covered in this DS-GA class (e.g. data cleaning, cross-validation, and sampling bias).</p>

        <p>Course details can be found in the <a href="docs/syllabusDS-GA1003-Spring2015.pdf">syllabus</a>.</p>

        <p>This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, graders, and the instructor. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, you are encouraged to <a href="https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2016/dsga1003/home">post your questions on Piazza</a>. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email <a href="mailto:team@piazza.com">team@piazza.com</a>.  Without registering, you can also view an <a href="https://piazza.com/class/i2jg9qgaxwr5fq?cid=14">anonymized version of our Piazza board</a>.</p>

            <dt><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/index.html"><cite>Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</cite> (Kevin P. Murphy)</a>
            <dd>This will be the required textbook for the class. It was chosen for several reasons: First, it covers an unusually broad set of topics, and it will serve you well as a reference for many topics beyond the scope of this course. Second, it is has a surprisingly extensive coverage of recent advances in the field, incorporating material that would otherwise only be available in research papers.  Finally, if you're a Matlab coder, there is <a href="https://github.com/probml/pmtk3">extensive software support</a>.

            <dt><a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/"><cite>The
            Elements of Statistical Learning</cite> (Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani)</a>
            <dd>This book is available as a free PDF, and it will
            serve as a nice complement to Murphy's book.  Despite its popularity and the pretty pictures, this is not an easy book.  It's written by three statisticians who invented many of the techniques discussed.

    	    <dt><a href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/"><cite>Convex Optimization</cite> (Boyd and Vandenberghe)</a>
            <dd>This book (also available as a free PDF) was an instant hit in the machine learning community when it was published in 2004.  Most of the optimization problems that we know how to solve are convex problems.  We will be making light use of this book, mostly for its coverage of Lagrangians and duality.  However, it's a good book to get familiar with, as it's very well written and it covers a lot of techniques used in more advanced machine learning literature.

            <dt><a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"><cite>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</cite> (James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani)</a>
            <dd>This book (also available as a free PDF), is written
            by two of the same authors as The Elements of Statistical Learning. It's much less intense mathematically, and it's good for a lighter introduction to the topics.

        <p><strong>Late Policy:</strong> Homeworks are due at {{assignmentsFrontmatter.[Due time]}} on the date specified.  Homeworks will still be accepted for 48 hours after this time but will have a 20% penalty.

        <p><strong>Collaboration Policy:</strong> You may discuss problems with your classmates. However, you must write up the homework solutions and the code from scratch, without referring to notes from your joint session.  In your solution to each problem, you must write down the names of any person with whom you discussed the problem—this will not affect your grade.
